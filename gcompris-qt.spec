%description
GCompris-Qt is a high quality educational software suite comprising

Currently GCompris offers in excess of 100 activities and more

technology. It is developed within the KDE community and is
part of the GNU Project.

from a single unified user interface.

GCompris is designed in a way that it is easy to add new activities
